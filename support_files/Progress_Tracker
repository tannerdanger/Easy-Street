Rework Code: 
{
	turn- 
		if( fwd = light || fwd = street || left = street || left == light ....)
	into - a helper method called isValid() where you send it a direction and it determines if its valid.
		*possibly have a different loop for each vehicle type that uses the behavior of each class
		*try to put this isValid into the canPass to shorten code ("try to wrap it in a private helper method")
